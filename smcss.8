.SH DESCRIPTION

.B smcss
prints information about the Linux AF_SMC sockets and link groups.
The type of information printed is controlled by the first argument, as follows:
.TP
.BR (none)
.br
displays a list of connecting, closing, or connected SMC sockets with basic
information.

.TP
.BR "\-a, \-\-all"
displays all types of SMC sockets: listening, opening, closing, and connected.

.TP
.BR "\-l, \-\-listening"
shows listening sockets only. These are omitted by default.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR "\-d, \-\-debug"
displays additional debug information, such as shutdown state.

.TP
.BR "\-D, \-\-smcd
displays additional SMC-D specific information. Shows SMC-D sockets only.

.TP
.BR "\-R, \-\-smcr
displays additional SMC-R specific information. Shows SMC-R sockets only.

.TP
.BR "\-W, \-\-wide"
do not truncate IP addresses.

.SH OUTPUT

.SS "State"
The state of the socket.
The state can be one of these values:
.TP
.I
INIT
The SMC socket is being initialized. It is not connected nor
listening yet.
.TP
.I
CLOSED
The SMC socket is closed. It is not connected nor listening
anymore.
.TP
.I
LISTEN
The SMC socket is a listening socket, waiting for incoming connection requests.
.TP
.I
ACTIVE
The SMC socket has an established connection.
In this state, the TCP connection is fully established,
rendezvous processing has been completed, and SMC peers
can exchange data via RDMA.
.TP
.I
PEERCLW1
No further data will be sent to the peer.
.TP
.I
PEERCLW2
No further data will be sent to or received from the peer.
.TP
.I
APPLCLW1
No further data will be received from the peer.
.TP
.I
APPLCLW2
No further data will be received from or sent to the peer.
.TP
.I
APPLFINCLW
The peer has closed the socket.
.TP
.I
PEERFINCLW
The socket is closed locally.
.TP
.I
PEERABORTW
The socket was abnormally closed locally.
.TP
.I
PROCESSABORT
The peer has closed the socket abnormally.
.SS "UID"
User ID of the SMC socket.
.SS "Inode"
Inode attribute of the socket.
.SS "Local Address"
Address and port number of the local end of the SMC socket. 
The displayed address is truncated when it ends with '..'.
.BR "-W, --wide"
can be used to display addresses untruncated.
.SS "Peer Address"
Address and port number of the remote end of the socket.
Analogous to "Local Address".
.SS "Intf"
When the socket is explicitly bound with setsockopt option SO_BINDTODEVICE then
Intf shows the interface number of the Ethernet device to which the socket is bound.
.SS "Mode"
.TP
.I
SMCD
The SMC socket uses SMC-D for data exchange.
.TP
.I
SMCR
The SMC socket uses SMC-R for data exchange.
.TP
.I
TCP
The SMC socket uses the TCP protocol for data exchange, because an SMC connection 
could not be established.
.TP
In case of an error during connection setup, respective error codes will be displayed in the format <local>/<remote>.
